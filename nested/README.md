# nested

Models for nested (or clustered) data structures, e.g., repeated measurements, grouped data, etc. Variations include normal, binary (probit), and Poisson data models, as well as models with varying-intercepts, varying-intercepts and varying-slopes, "mixed effects" models that contain both fixed and random effects, and models that include group-level predictors.
