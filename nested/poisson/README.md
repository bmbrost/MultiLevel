#poisson

Poisson data models for counts. Variations include a varying-intercept model (labeled *.varying.intercept), a varying-intercepts and varying-slopes model (labeled *.varying.coefficients), a "mixed effects" models that contains both fixed and random effects (models labeled *.mixed), andmodels that include group-level predictors (labeled *.group).

- poisson.varying.coef.mcmc.R: MCMC algorithm for model with a varying-intercept and varying-slopes
- poisson.varying.coef.sim.R: Simulate data with a varying-intercept and varying-slopes according to model poisson.varying.coef.mcmc.R
